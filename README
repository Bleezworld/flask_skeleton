This is a very bare website skeleton built on top of Flask.

It has support for signup/login, mapreduce, Google's protobufer, localization, etc
Everything you need for a small website with a clean architecture with all you need but not more.

Make sure MongoDB is running, then execute

    python run_server --debug

You can play around on the /install folder to install on a fixed IP server.
