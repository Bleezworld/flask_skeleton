This is a very bare website skeleton built on top of Flask.

It has support for signup/login, mapreduce, Google's protobufer, localization, etc
Everything you need for a small website with a clean architecture with all you need but not more.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Have MondoDB installed and running
- Have Google's Protobuf library installed
- run serveur/db/generate_protos.sh to compile the .proto file


RUNNING:
Make sure MongoDB is running, then execute

    python run_server --debug

You can play around on the /install folder to install on a fixed IP server.


Visit /api to see the API of the website. It is generated on the fly based on comments from various handlers.

Have fun and don't hesitate to tweak around and send me some pull requests!
